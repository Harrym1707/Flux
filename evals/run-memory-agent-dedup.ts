/**
 * Night's new-lever research: continuous-learning / continuous-memory
 * agents (founder mandate shape list, item 3).
 *
 *   node --import tsx evals/run-memory-agent-dedup.ts
 *
 * The shape: an application maintains a memory block (user preferences,
 * standing facts, a running checklist) and re-injects it, unchanged, at the
 * front of every user turn - this is exactly how frameworks with a
 * conversation-level "memory" concept (LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory,
 * mem0-style memory stores, a hand-rolled system/context block some teams
 * glue onto every call because their provider SDK has no separate memory
 * channel) actually wire the request. `evals/run-workload-matrix.ts`
 * already carries this shape as "memory agent" and flagged (see
 * docs/rnd/2026-10-22-workload-matrix-findings.md, finding 1) that none of
 * FLUX's existing levers touch it: `duplicateContext` only ever dedupes
 * within ONE message's text, and the memory block is not its own paragraph
 * inside any single message - it is the shared PREFIX of many messages
 * that each continue differently. The shape's own system prompt is also
 * below the 1,024-token documented cacheable minimum, so the cache stamp
 * earns nothing here either: this lever is genuinely the shape's only
 * lever.
 *
 * This eval measures THREE arms, and keeps the lossy arm clearly
 * separate from the lossless stack, honestly:
 *
 *   A. raw            - no FLUX at all, uncached (the measured default:
 *                        Anthropic's cache is opt-in).
 *   B. lossless stack - toolSchemas + duplicateContext + repairCachePrefix
 *                        + the 5m cache stamp. This is what
 *                        run-workload-matrix.ts already reports for this
 *                        shape: a near-zero win, by design, because none of
 *                        those levers reach a block repeated ACROSS
 *                        messages.
 *   C. B + crossTurnMemoryDedup (NEW, LOSSY) - replaces the memory block in
 *                        every later user turn with a short reference
 *                        marker, keeping turn 1's block and every turn's
 *                        own differing remainder verbatim (see
 *                        packages/core/src/token-reduction.ts,
 *                        dedupeRepeatedLeadingBlock). Reported separately
 *                        and labelled LOSSY because the duplicate removed
 *                        is never adjacent to its twin: a model that
 *                        attends less to context far back in a long
 *                        history may behave differently with the block
 *                        present once near the start versus restated fresh
 *                        every turn. This arm's saving is NOT claimed as a
 *                        qualified win - it is reported as a candidate that
 *                        needs a replay-gate pass on a customer's own
 *                        traffic (packages/sdk-js/src/replay-gate.ts)
 *                        before it may ever be billed.
 *
 * All figures are SIMULATOR-measured against catalogued prices, labelled so.
