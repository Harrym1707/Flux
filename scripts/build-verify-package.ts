/**
 * Build the publishable @flux-ai/verify artifact into packages/verify/pkg:
 *   - index.js / index.cjs  (bundles; the needed @flux/core sources inlined)
 *   - types/                (hand-rolled entry + copied core declarations)
 *   - bin/flux-verify.mjs   (chain-verify + recompute an invoice from a spool)
 *   - LICENSE               (MIT — deliberately, see below)
 *   - package.json, README.md
 *
 * WHY THIS PACKAGE EXISTS: FLUX's product is BUSL-1.1, but an honesty claim
 * you cannot independently check is worthless. The tools that CHECK FLUX —
 * hash-chain verification and invoice recomputation — are published
 * separately under MIT so a customer (or a sceptic) can audit any FLUX
 * number with no commercial terms attached. Zero dependencies, no network
 * access, no telemetry.

The verification half of [FLUX](https://www.fluxtoken.dev), under MIT.

FLUX bills 1% of verified LLM API savings from an append-only, hash-chained
ledger that lives on the customer's own disk. An honesty claim you cannot
independently check is worthless — so the tools that CHECK FLUX's numbers are
published here, separately, under MIT, with zero dependencies and no network
access. The FLUX product itself is source-available under BUSL-1.1; this
package is not, on purpose.

\`\`\`bash
npx -y -p @flux-ai/verify flux-verify flux-ledger/proxy-anthropic.jsonl
\`\`\`

verifies every hash link in the spool and recomputes the invoice from its
events. If your recomputation disagrees with a number FLUX quoted you, yours
wins — that is the contract.

Library use:

\`\`\`js
import { verifyLedgerChain, recomputeInvoice } from "@flux-ai/verify";
