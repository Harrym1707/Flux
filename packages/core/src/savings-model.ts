/**
 * Composable cost-reduction model.
 *
 * A single lever looks unimpressive. Model routing on LLMRouterBench's MMLU-Pro
 * returned 9.73% and bought it with quality. The levers below are different in
 * two ways: most of them do not touch the answer, and they attack disjoint parts
 * of a request, so they compose rather than compete.
 *
 * A request is modelled as segments, because each lever only reaches some of
 * them. Tool-schema minification cannot help a RAG prompt with no tools, and
 * prefix caching cannot help the one segment that changes every request. Summing
 * headline percentages across levers double-counts; applying them to the
 * segments they actually target does not.
 *
 * Order matters and is fixed: reducers shrink segments first, then caching prices
 * whatever stable tokens remain. Minifying a tool catalogue and then caching it
 * must charge the cache rate on the minified size, not the original.
 *
 * Every lever carries the published evidence for its reduction factor. Those
 * factors come from their authors' benchmarks, not from FLUX measuring them on
 * your traffic, so a projection from this model is a hypothesis to verify by
 * replay, never a realised saving. Realised savings come from provider-reported
 * usage priced through the catalogue.
